### Day 4: December 21, 2018

**Thought**: I'm glad I don't have to bother with hosting service and have the leisure to experimenting with code.

### Day 5: December 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  I learned positioning in CSS and started on a snake game in C++. 

**Thought**: I'm glad I'm making progress. I need to get the hang of keeping things in a repoository so they're easy to link to.
